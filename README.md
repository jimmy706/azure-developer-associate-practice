# Main topics
- **Azure Cosmos db** – Try to create a container in the portal, and try to insert, delete records. You might see **questions that have a query and will be asked the results of execution.** Also, remember the consistency levels of **Strong, Consistent Prefix, Bounded Staleness, Eventual.** Be aware of what to use when.
- **Azure WebApps** – Create a webApp in the portal multiple times. **Remember you need an app service plan first.** Familiarize yourself with all the plan types offered – **Free and Shared, Basic, Premium, Isolated.** I’m sure you will see a few questions here.
- **Azure WebJobs** – While the exam will not ask you on how to code a webjob but **remember the series of steps to create a WebJob. Understand the difference between continuous and triggered.**
- As part of security, learn the usage of **Key-Vault**, especially with **Disk Encryption to store keys and secrets**. I remember seeing questions around **“Always Encrypted” and OAUTH.**
- **Queues** – A very important topic for which you will see few questions. Understand the options enabled in portal like **sessions, partitioning, dead letter queue.** I did get some code related **syntax questions** here. Another important point to remember in queues is **Topic Filter and Actions.**
- On a similar note, a topic of confusion is often the use cases for Azure message-based solutions – **Azure Functions, Event Grid, Event Hubs, and Azure Service Bus**
- One of the major selling point of **Azure is its Active Directory**, so it should not come as a surprise that you will see questions related to AAD in the exam. Few [important concepts]([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis#:~:text=Azure Active Directory (Azure AD,thousands of other SaaS applications.). are **Azure B2B, B2C, PIM, User Authentication (including MFA), Application Management and usage of managed identity from AAD.**
- **Caching and content delivery:** **Know how to invalidate the cache. You will see a question or two around application cache patterns.**
- Remember, this is a developer certification – you might see **some syntax related questions.**
- Under **[Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/usage-overview)**, remember to check all topics like **Funnels, Cohorts, Impact, Retention, User Flows** etc.
- Know the differences between **tiers and plans for various services**, especially with limitations, scaling features
